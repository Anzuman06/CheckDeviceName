# Project1
This project is on basis of the task "Create a cypress auto test plan from scratch", In this task it has been asked to Create a test that will check if the device name that is displayed on the device details is correct.


  So I've created two scripts on this ticket in order to test the expected result in two different ways. In both scenarios, I've automated the plan successfully and could able to log in to my canary cloud account, select particular device, open the device form and also checked the value of the device name field on the device form details using checking assertion.



# Running the tests from command line
Navigate to the e2e folder where the spec files(1st and 2nd) are included and run the following:

    npx cypress run --headed --spec .\cypress\e2e\#.cy.js
